# Overview
  The basic flow of my program is that when the user enters a command, 
  it will parse the command and store it in a job list data structure 
  we create. Then we will determine if it is either an empty command or 
  invalid command. If not we go to the next round of entering commands. 
  If it is valid, we will check if it is built-in command. If it is a 
  built-in command, we will run the command in the parent proces. Then 
  we will fork a process. In that child process, if it is a built-in 
  command, we just normally exit the child and if not we run the command.
  In the parent process after forking, we check if it is a pipeline 
  command, and run pipeline if it is. Then we will check if we need to 
  wait for the job to complete (a command or a pipeline of commands), 
  and store the exit status to corresponding commands. Then we will 
  check if there are any background pocesses completed, if so we get 
  the exit status for them and mark it as finished. Then at last, we 
  print out the completed message for the process if it is marked finished. 
  Then we repeat the above process until the user enters exit.

# Implementation

## Data Structures
  We used two linked lists for storing the jobs and commands. We have 
  a struct called job list which is a linked list of jobs. A job is a 
  linked list of commands. The command contains the process id, the 
  command line, the command arguments, input files if any, output files 
  if any, finish flag for completion indication, exit status, number of 
  input files, number of output files, number of arguments, job also 
  contains a flag called finish to indicate if the job is finished, and 
  number of background  flags. The job contains the whole command line 
  and finish flag to indicate if all commands are finished.
  ## Parsing
  We have two functions to take care of parsing: readjob() and 
  readcommand(). After fgets, we store the whole command line to the 
  job, and parse through the command to find the number of processes 
  by finding how many '|' are there (for error checking). Then we use 
  strtok() to seperate the command line into each command as a token 
  where we use readcommand() to manually parse that token. In 
  readcommand(), we first get rid of any leading and trailing spaces 
  and tabs. Then we manually parse through it. If we see a space, '<',
  '>' or '&', we stop and handle the string before that terminator. 
  If it's a space, we read that string as an argument for the command. 
  If it is a '<' or '>', we set the flag that reminds us to read the 
  input file or output file for the next terminator. If it is a '&', 
  we simply increment the background flag for that command. We 
  continue this process until reaches the end of the command. If the 
  flag for reading input or output is still set, that means the input 
  file or output file is not given. We basically set input file or 
  output file as NULL for later error checking. We repeat readcommand()
  until strtok cannot find any more commands to read.

## Error Checking
  For all the pre-run errors, we check the errors of a job that is already
  stored from parsing by checking one command at time for that job by 
  parsing that command. If we encounter '<', we check for input mislocation
  and no input and cannot open input errors. If we encounter '>', we 
  check for no output file and cannot open file errors. If we encounter 
  a '&', we check for background mislocation error. At the end, we check 
  for output mislocation error. If we have a error, we simply return 
  before running it and report it. For the run error (command not found, 
  directory not command, active jobs still running), we find out them after 
  running the command and report it.  
  
  **Is Empty Command**: This is not an error but we still check it before 
  the actual error checking. We simply check if it is   a null terminator, 
  '\0' after getting rid of the leading spaces.  
  
  **Invalid Command Line**: For thie error, we check if the command we 
  store is NULL (it happends when there are less commands than we expect 
  them to be), or is starting with '<', '>', '\0', '&', or '|'.
  
  **Command Not Found**: This errors happends when execvp fails, we 
  simply prints out the message after that.
  
  **Directory Not Found**: This errors happends when cd fails 
  (returns -1 from chdir), we prints out message afterthat.
  
  **No Output/Input File**: We check these two errors by checking if
  the stored file array in command struct is NULL(mentioned in parsing).
  
  **Cannot Open Input/Output File**: We check theses two errors by 
  using open() and check if open() returns -1.
  
  **Input/Output Mislocated**: When we go through the commands in 
  the job, we have the index, we simply checks if the index is the 
  first one for input and if it is the last one for output.
  
  **Background Mislocated**: When we go through the commands in the 
  job, we have the index, we simply checks if the index is the last 
  one and if that background sign is the last character of that 
  command string.
  
  **Active Jobs still Running**: We check this error when the user 
  tries to exit. We checks if the job list is empty except for that exit job.

## Built-in Commands
  **CD**: We use chdir() for this function.  
  **PWD**: We use getcwd for this function.  
  **EXIT**: We simply exit the program if there is no active jobs.
  
## Input and Output Redirections
  **Input Redirection**: For input redirection, we replaces STDIN FILENO 
  with that file using dup2. Since there can be more than one input 
  files, we loop the saved input files and replaces STDIN FILENO.
  
  **Output Redirection**: Same as above, but we replaces 
  STDOUT FILENO instead.  
  
## Pipeline
  For checking if we have pipeline commands, I simply check if that job 
  has more commands.  
  
  For doing pipeline, we first creat a pipe in the main function. At the 
  child process, we use dup2 to replace STDOUT FILENO with the writing 
  portion of the pipe and run that process, then in the parent process 
  we pass the reading portion of the pipe and the next process to the 
  recursive function pipeline(). In pipeline() function, we create a 
  new pipe if there are commands to pipe after this process, and creat 
  a new child process for this process (which is the next process of the 
  previous one before calling pipeline()) and connect the old reading 
  portion of the pipe to STDIN FILENO (which should have the input from 
  last process). Then we connect the writing portion of the new pipe 
  to STDOUT FILENO in the child process if there is more command to pipe. 
  Then in the parent process, we continue to call pipeline() and pass 
  the new pipe if there are more commands to pipe. We continue this 
  process until we reach the end of the pipe line. Then the output 
  will just print out to STDOUT or files we redirect.
  
  For getting the status of the exited child process. We wait for any 
  process after the pipeline until the job is finished. (as mentioned in 
  data structure, the job is finished when all the sub processes are 
  finished). When we get a completed child process, and get his id and 
  status, we use that id to find that command in the job and set the status 
  and the finish flag. 
  ## Background
  For checking if we have background, we check if the last command of the 
  pipeline (or only one command) has the background flag set.  
   
  For doing background, we don't wait for the job to finish after doing 
  pipeline. We then go through the job list for background process 
  (not including the one that just added) to see if any of the process 
  is finished using waitpid with an option of WNOHANG. If it returns 0,
  it means it is not finished. At the end, we will print out the completed 
  job in the order they are entered by the user. When we have a new job, 
  we insert it to the end of the job list, we go through the job list 
  and check if they are finished. If so print out their completion 
  message and delete them in the job list.
# Testing
  For testing, I simply come up different test cases for each phase and 
  manually test it and compare the results with sample program.
